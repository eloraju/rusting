# Learning rust and chess

## Starting off

This repo is part of Wunderdog's intrest groups and in this case rust intrest group. The goal is to try and learn a new language - rust - while working on something that's interesting and beneficial. If you haven't picked it up yet, I've gone ahead and decided I'd like to learn Rust.

## What's in the box?

Hopefully something that resembles a chess engine...

Maybe creating a terminal program that you can solve puzzles with could actually be the thing to strive towards.

### How to build a chess engine

ðŸ¤·

[Chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) has been a decent source so far but. But since I'm a dumdum I might have to search for 'How to engine - For dummies'...

I need to be able to 

1. Keep track of the board state
2. Analyze the state and generate moves
3. Handle more nieche stuff like en passant and castling
4. ????
5. Become the next Murphy

Sillyness aside, I should be able to build this thing more or less incrementally. Starting with initializing a board and coming up with a way to print out the board to the terminal. After that's done I might move on to inputting moves (no validation yet). My initial idea was to have the engine run as a daemon and then using commands like `rce Ne5 (move knight to E5)` trying to move a piece on the board. That would be extremely cool since with those two features and a way of importing chess puzzles, I could create a terminal chess puzzle program! I don't have to validate the moves, just check whether the move is the one the puzzle is looking for or not. 


## Developemnt

I'll post small updates on what is happening with the engine

Started the project! I did have a idea of what Rust is and that helped to get me even this far. In the span of about 8 hours I managed to read up quite a bit on how a chess engine works and what is actually needed to have a workign engine. A bug free core is mentioned multiple times soooo... Tests? I also managed to create the first iteration of the board representation. At first I really wanted to create a bitboard, but that proved to be a bit too much to take in this early on. I decided to make this first go a bit easier for myself and pivoted to using just multi-dimensional array. Once I did that it took me maybe a couple of hours to get to the point where I had the program spewing the board into the terminal! Next up I should come up with a way to initialize the board with a custom state. Gotta look into PGN and FEN.. Maybe I'll start with just a string or array of strings? I would like to see how IO works with rust so maybe a text file with 8x8 char matrix?

### 22-03-30

Didn't have that much time today. Bascially just spent my time refactoring the whole thing a bit and trying to come up with a way to represent board history neatly. Initial idea was to have the whole Game object be a doubly linked list that one could easily traverse but that turned out to be easier to thin that to implement. I've left the codebase in shatters for now. Maybe I'll figure something out over easter.

Maybe I'll just have to KISS and revert back to what I had before, create a FEN/PGN parser and go from there towards the puzzle solver idea I had yesterday.
