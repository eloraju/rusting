# Learning rust and chess

## Starting off

This repo is part of Wunderdogs intrest groups and in this case rust intrest group. The goal is to try and learn a new language - rust - while working on something that's interesting and benefitial. If you haven't picked it up yet, I've gone ahead and decided I'd like to learn Rust.

## What's in the box?

Hopefully something that resembles a chess engine...

### How to build a chess engine

🤷

[Chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) has been a decent source so far but. But since I'm a dumdum I might have to search for 'How to engine - For dummies'...

I need to be able to 

1. Keep track of the board state
2. Analyze the state and generate moves
3. Handle more nieche stuff like en passant and castling
4. ????
5. Become the next Myrphy

Sillynes aside, I should be able to build this thing more or less incrementally. Starting with initializing a board and coming up with a way to print the board out to the terminal. After that's done I might move on accepting moves. My initial idea was to have the engine run as a daemon and then using commands like `rce Ne5` trying to move a piece on the board. That would be extremly cool since I could since with those two features and a way of importing chess puzzles, I could create a terminal chess puzzle program!
